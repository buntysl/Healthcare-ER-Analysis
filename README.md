  Most ER congestion occurs between 6 PM and 10 PM, often exceeding acceptable wait thresholds.

- **Non-Urgent Cases Occupying Resources**  
  A significant percentage of ER visits are non-urgent, which strains critical resources.

- **Weekend Spike in Visits**  
  Patient volume tends to increase on weekends, suggesting the need for flexible staffing.

- **Triage Imbalance**  
  Critical patients have longer-than-expected wait times, possibly due to triage inefficiencies.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Implement Fast-Track Zones**  
  Separate non-urgent cases to reduce their impact on critical care pathways.
